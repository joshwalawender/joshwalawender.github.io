# Visiting Hawaii:  A Guide for the Astronomy Enthusiast

## PART I:  Introduction to Hawaii and Maunakea

To most people’s minds, Hawaii conjures up images of luxurious tropical sun, beautiful beaches, mai tais, and flowered shirts.  To astronomers, on the other hand, it represents dark nights, clear skies, and access to southerly constellations (and maybe some mai tais and beach time on the side).  I’ve lived here in Hawaii (on the Big Island) for a few years and have met visitors from all over through volunteering at the Mauna Kea Visitor Information Station and by giving a few tours through my work with the University of Hawaii.  I’m occasionally contacted by amateur astronomers who are planning on visiting Hawaii and are interested in seeing the observatories or in doing some observing here.  As a result I’ve compiled advice for visitors interested in astronomy and Mauna Kea in particular.  

I’ll start this article with an introduction to Hawaii in general and the observatories on Mauna Kea in particular.  Later on I’ll summarize my advice about visiting the island for astronomy.

### The Hawaiian Island Chain and Hawaiian Volcanoes

As some visitors know, Hawaii can refer both to the entire state, or to the island of Hawaii.  Some will make the distinction between being ‘in Hawaii’ (the state) or ‘on Hawaii’ (meaning the island), but I’ll refer to the Island of Hawaii as ‘The Big Island’ to avoid confusion.  There are eight main islands in the Hawaiian chain, four of which are major tourist destinations (Kauai, Oahu, Maui, and The Big Island).  The majority of this article is about The Big Island, but I’ll mention other islands briefly near the end.  What makes The Big Island such a destination for astronomy is its mountains.

The Hawaiian island chain is made up of volcanos which form above a ‘hot spot’ in the Earth’s crust where magma billows up, and emerges on the sea floor.  These volcanos  build up until they breach the surface and become a volcanic island.  As the Pacific plate moves across the hot spot, the volcanic activity moves south and east along the island chain.  Therefore the oldest islands are to the northwest (i.e. Kauai) and the youngest are to the southeast (The Big Island).  

The Big Island truly deserves its nickname.  Its land area is larger than all the other Hawaiian Islands combined.  It is made up of five volcanos (Kohala, Hualalai, Mauna Kea, Mauna Loa, and Kilauea).  Another volcano, Lo’ihi, is currently building a new island a few thousand feet below the waves, just off the south coast of the Big Island.  The oldest volcano, Kohala, forms the north part of the island.  It is extinct and heavily eroded, appearing more as a ridge line than a mountain.  Hualalai is an 8,271 foot peak which overlooks the resort areas on the Kona Coast.  Odds are, if you’re staying on the Big Island, you’re on the Kona Coast in view of Hualalai.  Hualalai is considered dormant (not extinct), so don’t get too comfortable.  It last erupted around 1801.

Mauna Loa dominates the island.  It is the largest active volcano on Earth and last erupted in 1984.  Like Olympus Mons on Mars and most other Hawaiian volcanos, it is a ‘shield’ volcano,  meaning that the lava which erupts from it is fairly liquid and flows out and down the slopes forming the smooth gradual slope of the volcano.  Because the slope is so gradual, Mauna Loa can sometimes appear deceptively small and nearby.  From certain vantage points on the island Mauna Loa can seem to be a nearby hill only a few hundred or few thousand feet high (see photo).  In fact, the summit is 13,679 feet (4,169 meters) above sea level, high enough that it can be snow capped in winter, even here in the tropics.  Because its slopes are so gradual, Mauna Loa contains an enormous volume of rock.  The mountain is so massive that the crust of the Earth is depressed underneath it by its bulk.







If you want to use the sites above the VIS, you’ll need a four wheel drive vehicle to get up there.  Also, check in at the VIS to let them know.  The rangers generally try to shoo people of the summit area after sunset, so you’ll want to make sure it is okay for you to stay and that they know what you are doing.

The third high altitude site is on Mauna Loa.  Just below the Mauna Loa Atmospheric Observatory around 11,000 feet is a small parking lot for the hiking trail to the summit.  This site allows you to get to a higher elevation than the VIS without needing four wheel drive.  The road is one lane and rough, but is quite passable by a passenger car.  Like the other high altitude sites discussed here it has no amenities.

If you’re on Maui, Haleakala is another excellent observing site.  I’m not as familiar with it, but the Haleakala Amateur Astronomers club (HAA) is quite friendly and they have a small observing site there.  As with all high altitude sites, wind will likely be the biggest problem while observing.

### Commercial Tours

There is one other way to do observing on Mauna Kea and that is to take a commercial tour.  These start around $200 per person and they drive you up to the summit for a tour and to watch sunset (no observatory access).  Warm jackets and a meal are provided, and you get a short observing session lower down on the slopes after dark.  These usually use 8-11 inch SCTs and last about an hour.  The quality and accuracy of the stargazing session can vary significantly depending on the individual tour guide. If you’re coming with family who wouldn’t be interested in staying for a full multi-hour observing session and don’t want to bother bringing heavy jackets or renting a four wheel drive vehicle, this is a good option.

### Local Resources

There are two astronomy clubs on the Big Island.  The larger and more active club is the <a class="class1" title="http://www.whacastro.com" href="http://www.whacastro.com">West Hawaii Astronomy Club (WHAC)</a>.  They meet monthly in Waimea at either the Keck or CFHT headquarters.  They have an online discussion group on Yahoo! Groups (search for WHAC) which can be quite helpful.  In addition to WHAC, there is a smaller club based in Hilo.  <a class="class2" title="http://www.hiloastro.org/HiloAstro/Welcome.html" href="http://www.hiloastro.org/HiloAstro/Welcome.html">The Hilo Astronomy Club (HAC)</a> is currently less active in that they have no regular meetings, but has an on line discussion group on Yahoo! Groups (search for HiloAstro) and regularly goes observing at the VIS.  Both clubs welcome queries from visitors so don’t hesitate to log on and post a question.

### Final Thoughts

I hope this encourages some of you to visit the islands.  This is a remarkable place astronomically, geologically, ecologically, and culturally.  There’s no where else on the planet as isolated as Hawaii is in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.  Despite, or perhaps because of that, it has a unique culture and environment and different visitors all with diverse interests will find something remarkable here to enjoy.
