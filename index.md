# About Me

I'm an astronomer living on the Big Island of Hawaii.  My research involves studying how young stars interact with their parent molecular cloud. I'm also an [alumnus](http://alumni.berkeley.edu/) of [The University of California at Berkeley](http://www.berkeley.edu/) where I majored in physics and astrophysics.  I went on to earn my PhD in [Astrophysical and Planetary Sciences](http://aps.colorado.edu) at the [University of Colorado at Boulder](http://www.colorado.edu/).
