# About Me

I'm an astronomer living on the Big Island of Hawaii.  My research involves studying how young stars interact with their parent molecular cloud.  My recent work has focused on instrumentation:  both small robotic telescopes and also research instruments for 8-10 meter class telescopes.

I'm an [alumnus](http://alumni.berkeley.edu/) of [The University of California at Berkeley](http://www.berkeley.edu/) where I majored in physics and astrophysics.  I went on to earn my PhD in [Astrophysical and Planetary Sciences](http://aps.colorado.edu) at the [University of Colorado at Boulder](http://www.colorado.edu/).

My hobbies include [Photography](photography.html) and [Amateur Astronomy](astronomy.html).
