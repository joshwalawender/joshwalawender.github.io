&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, I made another trip up the the saddle area between Mauna Loa and Maunakea to look at Comet NEOWISE.

&lt;p&gt;Another attempt at seeing Comet NEOWISE (C/2020 F3) last night was hampered by high cirrus, though the clouds resulted in some spectacular color in the sky at sunset.

&lt;p&gt;On Friday evening I took a drive up the Mauna Loa access road to meet some friends to look for Comet NEOWISE (C/2020 F3).
