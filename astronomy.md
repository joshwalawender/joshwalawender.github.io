## Astronomy

Iâ€™ve been an amateur astronomer since I was about eleven years old. At thirteen, I ground an 8 inch mirror in a class with the San Diego Astronomy Association. That mirror went into a simple dobsonian telescope which I used for many years. I'm still quite an active observer, getting out to a dark sky site as often as my life allows.
