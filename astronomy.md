## Astronomy

Iâ€™ve been an amateur astronomer since I was about eleven years old. At thirteen, I ground an 8 inch mirror in a class with the San Diego Astronomy Association. That mirror went into a simple dobsonian telescope which I used for many years. I'm still quite an active observer, getting out to a dark sky site as often as my life allows.

## IRAF Tutorial

While a grad student at the University of Colorado, I was the TA for the upper division observational astronomy course for four semesters.  I wrote a tutorial on the Image Reduction and Analysis Facility (IRAF) software commonly used at the time for image reductions in astrophysics.  Some still find it useful, so I've kept it online even though it is a bit out of date now:

I've also kept an even [older version](IRAFtutorial/index.html) available as well.
