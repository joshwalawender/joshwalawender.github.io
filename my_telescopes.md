## My Telescopes

**Stellarvue  SV102ABV**: 102mm f/8.0 doublet apo refractor

This is my most used scope. The optics are exquisite with stars reaching beautiful, color-free pinpoints. When I moved to Hawaii in 2006, this scope suffered some damage in transit. Fortunately, the lens was fine and Vic Maris at Stellarvue resurrected it with a whole new tube which is also binoviewer compatible.

**AstroSystems 16 Inch f/4.5 Truss Tube Dobsonian**:

I bought this telescope used and the mirror is originally from a Meade Starfinder. The mount was a little clunky and heavy, so I purchased a TeleKit from AstroSystems and built a new mount for it. The mirror was also refigured by Galaxy Optics in Buena Vista, CO.  This was a project scope for a long time and has been improved from a clunky telescope with poor optics, to a beautifully performing dobsonian.  The new optics are exquisite and allow me to take full advantage of excellent seeing and transparency conditions on Mauna Kea.

**Stellarvue AT1010 (aka Stellarvue Nighthawk)**

I got this after using a Celestron C90 and wanting wider fields. I saw an ad for Stellarvue which was still a new company at the time and ordered an AT1010. The AT1010 is a great scope which provided fantastic views, it is very sharp and an excellent size for quick looks.

### Previous Telescopes

**Department Store Refractor**

Like many others, I started in this hobby with a cheap department store refractor. I don't remember any of the details of this scope, but it did give some decent views of Saturn (or at least that's how I remember it). I had a lot of trouble finding anything else because of the standard flaw of a wobbly tripod. Luckily, I'd done enough reading at this point to know that a better telescope would show a lot more.

**Celestron C4.5 Newtonian**

This was my first "real" telescope. My parents bought this for me from OPT in Oceanside after we'd observed with the little department store refractor for a bit. The C4.5 was a great beginner scope despite a few flaws. The most glaring was that it was not a full 4.5 inch aperture. The secondary mirror was undersized and thus only used a portion of the primary mirror, probably around 3.5 to 4 inches. It was on a good equatorial mount (a Polaris, I believe) with wooden legs.

**8 Inch Home Built Dobsonian**

After using the C4.5 for a while at SDAA star parties and public viewing events, aperture fever struck. Conveniently, at about this time, the SDAA started a mirror grinding class and I started grinding an 8 inch mirror. This was a long process as I didn't really put a lot of time into it aside from going to the class each week, but after a couple of years, with a lot of help from my parents, I had a decent 8 inch mirror. It has a turned edge and probably isn't all that great a figure, but I was thrilled with it. We built a simple cardboard tube dob around it which I used for many years after and this is the scope I took with me to college in Berkeley (after I got a car there to haul it around) and eventually grad school in Boulder. It only got replaced when I got my 16 inch dob.

**Celestron C90 Spotting Scope**

After getting the 8 inch dob, I wanted a smaller, portable scope. I don't remember the exact sequence of events for this, but I happened to win this C90 scope in a raffle at an astronomy event which took place at SDSU. I took this scope with me to Berkeley and Boulder, but eventually sold it because I wanted wider field views that the maksutov design couldn't provide. My search for a wide field portable scope took me to Stellarvue and eventually to buying an AT1010.

**Stellarvue 80BV**: 80mm f/9.4 Achromatic Refractor

This is a nice grab and go scope which got me into binoviewing. I also used it as a guide scope while imaging. It is a long focus (f/9.4) achromat, so it has relatively little false color and provides wonderfully crisp views.
