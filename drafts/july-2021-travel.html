        <p>I did something unusual for me this July: astronomy related travel!  Between the pandemic and living in Hawaii, I don't typically get to go to many star parties.  On this trip, I attended the Stellarvue Dark Skies Star Party (SVDSSP) in Northern California.  </p>
<p>The SVDSSP is a private star party I've been to a number of times in the past.  I enjoy going to visit with my mainland astronomy friends and to spend several days away from work.  It is interesting to do a star party without being able to take much gear.  In fact, I didn't bring a telescope to this event and instead I depended on getting to look through other people's telescopes.</p>
<p>I really miss the social aspect of star parties.  There are no multi-night star parties here on the Big Island.  None of our observing sites permit camping, so we have no place to hold such an event.  In addition, one of the great things about star parties is that you draw attendees from all around, but again the island limits that sort of travel.</p>
<p>The skies up where SVDSSP is held are very dark, but at 41 degrees North latitude, I'm always a bit dismayed at how low all the southern constellations are and how late the twilight lasts.</p>
<p>The Star Party got very lucky with fires in California.  Even though there were a number of them burning in the state, the smoke stayed away from the star party location.  There was only a brief period of partial cloudiness, so the weather cooperated as well.</p>
<p>After the star party, I spent the next 10 days in the Lassen-Shasta area of Northern California.  Lassen National Park is one of my favorite places to hike and I was able to see some new areas even after having been there many times before.  As we were leaving a wildfire south of the park was expanding.  We were worried our route south would be closed, but we drove through some heavy smoke, but the roads we needed were open and we made it out.</p>

<p>Sadly, this fire blew up in the coming days and weeks.  The "Dixie" fire destroyed a small town which we drove through on our way out and eventually made its way to the National Park.  Based on the fire maps I've seen, it looks like many of the hikes we did on this trip burned.  I imagine that the park will be very different on future visits.</p>
