##    mkspeclist imagename linestart lineend
##    imagename -- filename of the image whose lines you wish 
##                 to combine
##    linestart -- line number of the first (lowest numbered)
##                 line to be combined
##    lineend   -- line number of the last (highest numbered)
##                 line to be combined
