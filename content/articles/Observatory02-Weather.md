Over the 5 years I've lived in this house, I've found that I have a decent amount of clear skies, but that wind and blowing rain will be a major problem.  I live on the "dry side" of the town of Waimea on the Big Island of Hawaii.  Waimea sits in the saddle between Maunakea and the Kohalas, so the prevailing trade winds are often funneled through this area and blow steadily.

The wind shake will be a factor for any observing unless the observatory can block the wind.  For this reason, I'd initially thought about using a dome style observatory.  I'm not a big fan of domes for small observatories.  It seems like many people build them for the look, but I wanted a more subtle look.  I also prefer the simplicity of a roll off roof.  The control system and electronics are far simpler because there's no need to bridge electricity across to the rotating part of the dome in order to operate the shutter.  While this is not too difficult these days (during my time as a postdoc I built a pair of robotic domed observatories), I wanted to keep my own build as simple as possible.

There's a second problem with the winds here.  In addition to wind shake, the winds often carry misty rain.  As the trade winds blow moisture up against the mountain slopes, it precipitates out as rain.  This is why Hilo and the Hamakua coast are so lush and green.  As a result, the leeward areas of Kawaihae and Waikoloa Village are very dry.

The Landsat image above shows this beautifully.  The dark green areas show where there is heavy rainfall and lush vegetation.  Rainfall in the Kohala mountains has carved out dramatic valleys on the windward side.  My house lies West of Waimea near where the slopes of Maunakea and Kohala meet and right at the boundary between the green and brown areas in the Landsat image.

The blowing rain means we get rainbows on an almost daily basis.

After watching the weather here for several years I know that I get plenty of clear skies -- enough to make an observatory useful, but the problem will be that wind.  As a result, I'll have to design the observatory to handle wind and make sure it can close reliably if the wind carries rain.

One of my first steps in planning was to install a decent weather station.  I've had an astronomy specific weather station (an AAG Cloudwatcher) with an anemometer attached to the corner of the house for a while, but that had to come down when the house was painted.  The wind readings from it were not reliable thanks to where I'd mounted it on the corner of the house.  The wind readings were extreme due to the air moving over the corner of the roof.  I recently installed a weather station (a Davis Vantage Vue) out at the edge of the property where it would get a better measure of the wind.

To install the weather station, I used an 8 foot section of aluminum pipe that I'd bought for this process (the Davis has a built in pole mount).  I dug out a hole roughly 16 inches deep and 10 inches across and set the pole in concrete.  While the concrete set, I used a spare "surveyor's tripod" and some gaffer tape to prevent the pole from tipping over.

Once the concrete had set, I attached the weather station, aligned it to North and I'm now getting much more reliable wind data.

In addition to the full Davis weather station, I also have a BloomSky.  This is a small weather station which has only a few basic sensors, but provides a wide angle image of the sky (daytime only).
