# Comet NEOWISE from the Coast

Another attempt at seeing Comet NEOWISE (C/2020 F3) last night was hampered by high cirrus, though the clouds resulted in some spectacular color in the sky at sunset.  We'd driven down to the coast below the Kohala mountains along the Akoni Pule Highway.  Our first site, up at the north end of the island, had too many low level clouds, so we headed south and ended up at a pullout along the road about half way between Kawaihae and Mahukona.

Even there, a few low level clouds coming over the Kohalas kept blocking out the comet, so while we did see it naked eye and with binoculars it was never quite as dramatic as [yesterday's view](july-2020-comet-neowise.html).
