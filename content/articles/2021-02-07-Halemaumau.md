I spent this past weekend in [Hawaii Volcanoes National Park](https://www.nps.gov/havo/index.htm).  It was my first trip there since the most recent eruption started in late December.  Hiking out to one of the overlooks situated almost due East of the crater late at night meant we had that whole section of the park to ourselves.

While there is not currently a direct view to the lava lake growing within the Halema'uma'u crater, it does light up the sky in the area producing a dramatic glow above the crater.

In the time lapse video below, you can see the glow of the Halema'uma'u lava lake against the night sky.  The constellations of Orion and Taurus can be seen as well as the Pleiades cluster.  Mars makes a brief appearance setting below the cloud and behind the column of vog rising up from the lava lake.
