# Comet NEOWISE in Twilight

On Friday evening I took a drive up the Mauna Loa access road to meet some friends to look for Comet NEOWISE (C/2020 F3).  We found a few adjacent pullouts along the road and we all watched the northeastern horizon as it got dark looking for the comet.  We eventually spotted it in binoculars through a gap in some cirrus that was skirting the horizon.

As it got dark, the comet and its tail became visible to the naked eye.  The tail was an arc a few degrees long and could be traced maybe 5 degrees in binoculars.  The view was somewhat limited by the cirrus, but the clouds did add some drama to photographs.

I combined a few sequences of images together in to time lapse videos of the comet.
