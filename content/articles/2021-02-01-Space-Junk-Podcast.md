Last week I was interviewed by Tony Darnell and Dustin Gibson of the Space Junk Podcast about what it is like to work at the big research telescopes.  The episode went live today.  It was a fun discussion which touched on a variety of topics including some of the cool technology I get to work with in my job, the latest research to come out of the Keck Observatory, and how people can get involved through citizen science.
